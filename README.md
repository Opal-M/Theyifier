# Theyifier
Turn gendered pronouns such as she and he into genderless pronouns like they.

Code originally written in Python, then changed to be a chrome extentsion

Gendered pronouns begone! Use this chrome extortion to rid of gendered pronouns automatically, no search and replace necessary. Just install and run and all your gendered pronouns will be replaced with they and them and their. 

[Note: Only works for English and also, English is a very annoying language so use your own brain to pick out which of the gender neutral pronouns are needed when given options] I did my best to cohere with the English language and make this extension as seamless as possible but the English language is strange and sometimes annoying, so bear with it and be thankful that we have gender neutral pronouns to begin with.

[To use this go into developer mode in the chrome extensions page and choose this folder/zip file. Then check enable and if you so choose Allow in incognito as well.] Have fun reading the inter-webs gendered pronoun free!
